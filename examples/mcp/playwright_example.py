Playwright MCP Server Example

This example demonstrates browser automation using the Playwright MCP server.
The PlaywrightMCPServer provider automatically handles all setup including:
- Node.js and npm detection
- @playwright/mcp package installation
- Browser installation (chromium, firefox, webkit)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Just run: python3 playwright_example.py

No manual setup required!
